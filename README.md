## Testing

---

My plan for testing this site is fairly simple, Once everything is in place  intend on checking the functionality of the site by playing through the game and testing for any issues, This testing will include the buttons, images  and text to make sure they all have consistent behavior and behavior that falls inline with my user stories.

After this I will pass the project code through the W3C validator and lighthouse in the google dev tools. I will then fix any issues and suggestions these tools present.
